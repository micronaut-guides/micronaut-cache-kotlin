We can verify that the cache works as expected with a JUNIT 5 test.

To use Java Junit tests in your Micronaut's Kotlin app configure your build test dependencies such as:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=javajunit]
}
----

[source, java]
.src/test/java/micronaut/example/micronaut/NewsServiceTest.java
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/test/java/example/micronaut/NewsServiceTest.java[]
}
----

<1> Used to configure the test method execution order for the annotated test class.
<2> Annotation used to define a Micronaut test
<3> Inject `NewsService` bean.
<4> Timeout annotation fails a test if its execution exceeds a given duration. It helps us verify that we are leaveraging the cache.
<5> Used to configure the order in which the test method should executed relative to other tests in the class.
