We can verify that the cache works as expected:

[source, kotlin]
.src/test/kotlin/micronaut/example/micronaut/NewsServiceTest.kt
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/test/kotlin/example/micronaut/NewsServiceTest.kt[]
}
----

<1> Used to configure the test method execution order for the annotated test class.
<2> Annotation used to define a Micronaut test
<3> Inject `NewsService` bean.
<4> Timeout annotation fails a test if its execution exceeds a given duration. It helps us verify that we are leaveraging the cache.
<5> Used to configure the order in which the test method should executed relative to other tests in the class.
